ClosedXML
=========

The easy way to OpenXML -http://closedxml.codeplex.com/



**Project Description**
=======================

ClosedXML makes it easier for developers to create Excel 2007/2010
files. It provides a nice object oriented way to manipulate the files
(similar to VBA) without dealing with the hassles of XML Documents. It
can be used by any .NET language like C\# and Visual Basic (VB).


 **What can you do with this?**
 ClosedXML allows you to create Excel 2007/2010 files without the Excel
application. The typical example is creating Excel reports on a web
server.
 If you've ever used the Microsoft Open XML Format SDK you know just how
much code you have to write to get the same results as the following 4
lines of code.

                var workbook = new XLWorkbook();
                var worksheet = workbook.Worksheets.Add("Sample Sheet");
                worksheet.Cell("A1").Value = "Hello World!";
                workbook.SaveAs("HelloWorld.xlsx");
